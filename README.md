To use in Linux

netstat -ant > ip.txt
bash ropy6.sh ip.txt

If you find yourself using Windows, consider installing Git Bash for Windows. Right-click on any empty space in the script's directory and choose "Open Git Bash Here." Then, execute:

netstat -ant > ip.txt
bash ropy6.sh ip.txt

Pssst: Maybe it's time to switch to Linux ;)
